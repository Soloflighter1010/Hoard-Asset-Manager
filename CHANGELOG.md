# Changelog

## 1.5.0

Tag manager.

### Both tools
- Your own tags, alongside the suggested ones. Tag an item from its details, or many items at once with
  **Select** (including **Select all shown** after filtering).
- A **Tags** panel to create, rename, merge and delete tags, and to keep or hide suggestions. Keeping a
  suggestion makes it your tag on every item whose name has that word, including ones you buy later, and
  any tag can match names that way.
- Hoard and Hoard Downloader share your tags, so tagging in one shows in the other. Tags added to a
  product apply to every copy you own on other stores.
- The sidebar lists your tags first, then suggestions.

### Hoard Downloader
- `asset.json` and `catalog.json` include your tags (`tags`) next to the suggestions (`suggested_tags`),
  and `tags.json` now lists your tags under `tags` and suggestions under `suggested`.

## 1.4.0

Works offline.

### Both tools
- The typefaces are bundled, so the pages look right without an internet connection, and they no longer
  load anything from Google Fonts. Nothing is fetched from outside your computer just to show a page.
- A notice appears when you're offline, saying what still works.
- A store that can't be reached is now reported as "couldn't reach", with your saved data left
  unchanged, instead of a raw browser error.

### Hoard
- After each refresh, every product image is saved, so your whole library shows its images offline.
  Turn this off with `"offline_images": false` in `config.json`.
- Refresh and Sign in say you're offline instead of trying. Signing out still works offline.

### Hoard Downloader
- Stores that can't be reached are skipped with a clear message, and the rest still sync.

## 1.3.0

Ready for a public release: safer pages, clear policies and documented code.

### Both tools
- A footer with the version and links to the project on GitHub, updates, problem reports, the privacy
  policy, the terms of use and the AI disclosure.
- Links from store pages and imported pages only open when they're ordinary web addresses. A crafted
  listing can't turn a link into a script.
- Product images are only fetched from public internet addresses, never from your home network or from
  files on your computer.
- The pages are sent with a strict Content-Security-Policy and headers that stop other websites from
  embedding them or reading their responses.
- With `--host 0.0.0.0`, other devices on your network need the access key the tool prints when it
  starts. Actions still only work from the computer running the tool.
- Outbound links no longer tell the store which page you came from.

### Project
- New documents: privacy policy, terms of use, copyright and credits, security policy and AI disclosure.
  Each release zip includes them.
- A developer guide in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and every function in the code now has a docstring.
- Dependency versions are capped at their current major versions.

## 1.2.1

Maintenance release; Hoard and Hoard Downloader work the same as in 1.2.0.
- Release builds no longer depend on a third-party GitHub Action, and the release for an existing
  version can be built again from the Actions tab.

## 1.2.0

Safer sign-ins, in both tools.
- Sign-ins moved out of the program folder into your user account's private app-data folder, so sharing,
  syncing or committing the program folder can't carry them. The first run moves existing sign-ins
  automatically and removes the old copy. Both tools now share one set of sign-ins.
- Saved sign-ins are encrypted by the operating system on every platform. On Linux and macOS the
  browser previously used a fixed, publicly known key, which made them readable to anything that could
  read the files. macOS users need to sign in again once.
- The two tools can no longer use the sign-ins at the same moment, which could damage them.
- Sign out of a store, or of every store, from the Hoard Downloader menu, Hoard's Stores panel, or the
  `logout` command.
- A Gumroad session cookie for headless use now comes from the `HOARD_GUMROAD_SESSION` environment
  variable. Keeping it in `config.json` still works but shows a warning.

## 1.1.0

### Hoard Downloader
- Downloads Booth purchases and gifts. Files come straight from Booth, interrupted downloads resume,
  and new versions a creator uploads are downloaded and listed as updated.
- Downloads Payhip purchases in a visible browser window, waiting while you complete Payhip's bot check.
  If Payhip won't let it in, it can read your library from a page you saved, and lists the rest in
  `Payhip/_download-yourself.html`; files you save there are recorded on the next sync.
- Stores you haven't signed in to are skipped instead of reported as failures.
- The menu has a single **Sign in to a store** entry covering all four stores.
- The downloads browser shows Booth and Payhip.

### Hoard
- No changes; version raised to match Hoard Downloader.

## 1.0.0

First release.

### Hoard
- One searchable page for everything you own on Booth, Gumroad, Jinxxy and Payhip, with store,
  tag and creator filters and links to each item's download page.
- Sign in and refresh each store from the page. A failed refresh keeps that store's previous list.
- Products you own on more than one store are pointed out, with a view of every copy.
- Booth items list their files with direct download links; Booth gifts and archived Gumroad
  purchases are labelled.
- Import a library page saved from your own browser, for stores that block automated browsers
  (Payhip today).

### Hoard Downloader
- Downloads everything you own on Gumroad and Jinxxy into one folder per product, with a separate
  manifest per store so nothing is fetched twice. Interrupted Gumroad downloads resume.
- Re-running only fetches new or changed files, and the summary lists files a creator has updated.
- Suggests tags from words shared across asset names.
- Includes a read-only library browser with thumbnails, search, filters, and buttons to open folders.
