# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First release.

### Hoard
- One searchable page for everything you own on Booth, Gumroad, Jinxxy and Payhip, with store,
  tag and creator filters and links to each item's download page.
- Sign in and refresh each store from the page. A failed refresh keeps that store's previous list.
- Products you own on more than one store are pointed out, with a view of every copy.
- Booth items list their files with direct download links; Booth gifts and archived Gumroad
  purchases are labelled.
- Import a library page saved from your own browser, for stores that block automated browsers
  (Payhip today).

### Hoard Downloader
- Downloads everything you own on Gumroad and Jinxxy into one folder per product, with a separate
  manifest per store so nothing is fetched twice. Interrupted Gumroad downloads resume.
- Re-running only fetches new or changed files, and the summary lists files a creator has updated.
- Suggests tags from words shared across asset names.
- Includes a read-only library browser with thumbnails, search, filters, and buttons to open folders.
